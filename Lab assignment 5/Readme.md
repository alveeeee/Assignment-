University: University of Information Technology and Sciences

Course: Simulation and Modeling Lab

Assignment: Lab Assignment 5

Due Date: 23 April 2025

Tasks Completed

Loaded a dataset of temperature readings.

Standardized the data using mean and standard deviation.

Conducted a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to check normality.

Compared empirical CDF with the standard normal CDF.

Visualized both CDFs to interpret the K-S test result.

Concepts Covered

NumPy: Statistical operations like mean and standard deviation.

SciPy: Conducting a K-S test for normality.

Matplotlib: Visualization of empirical vs theoretical distributions.

What I Learned

How to standardize data using z-scores.

How the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to test for normality.

How to visually compare empirical and theoretical distributions using CDFs.

Interpreting p-values and test statistics from the K-S test.

Output Preview

Mean: ~17.7°C, Standard Deviation: ~2.5°C

K-S Test Result: Test statistic and p-value are printed with decision logic

Visualization: A plot comparing the empirical CDF and the standard normal CDF
