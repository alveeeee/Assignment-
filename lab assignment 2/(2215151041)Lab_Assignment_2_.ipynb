        "When NumPy generates a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50 without a fixed seed, the values will change each time the code is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This happens because no specific starting point is set for the random number generator. As a result, each run produces a different set of random numbers, making the output unpredictable. Every time the program runs, NumPy initializes its random number generator differently, leading to a unique matrix with new values.\n",
        "\n",
        "This behavior is useful in scenarios where fresh randomness is needed, such as simulations, data augmentation, or generating unpredictable test cases.\n",
