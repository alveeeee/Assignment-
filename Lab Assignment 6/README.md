University: University of Information Technology and Sciences (UITS)

Course: Simulation and Modeling Lab

Assignment: Lab Assignment 6

Due Date: 21 February 2025


# Tasks Completed

Simulated 60 weeks of inventory ordering using Monte Carlo simulation based on historical inventory probabilities.

Calculated:

Average Order Size

Average Weekly Cost (Ordering + Holding)

Simulated Single Server Queue for 200 customers under:

λ = 3, μ = 4 → Efficient System

λ = 8, μ = 6 → Overloaded System

Implemented a queue limit of 10 customers to evaluate customer rejection and queue control.

Concepts Covered

Monte Carlo Simulation for inventory management.

Single Server Queueing Theory:

Average wait time

Server utilization

Customer rejection rates

Probability Distributions using numpy.random:

np.random.choice() for inventory levels

np.random.exponential() for arrival/service times

Simulation-driven decision making for cost efficiency and service optimization.

# What I Learned

How to model and simulate inventory restocking decisions using random distributions.

Impact of mismatched arrival and service rates in queue performance.

Value of queue capacity constraints in controlling overloads.

Importance of simulation in making data-driven business decisions in a risk-free environment.
Submission

The .ipynb notebook containing all simulation code and analysis is included in this repository.

All simulations were executed in Google Colab using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
